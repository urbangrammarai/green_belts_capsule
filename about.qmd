# About

This resource is part of the [Urban Grammar](https://urbangrammarai.xyz) project and contains a [capsule](https://urbangrammarai.xyz/capsules.html). Capsules are informally defined as bits of work that take "more than a blog post but less than anything else". Capsules are explorations of how the data products generated by the Urban Grammar are useful in a variety of contexts. They are data-driven narratives, presented in as close to fully reproducible way as possible and, as the name suggest, encapsulated in their own repository so they are portable. 

If you need to, you can cite this capsule using the following citation:
